# Computer_network_project
In this Project of Chatting system, there are two files named(server and client). 

The main Idea is that there is one server and alot of number of clients that want to send some message to that server (admin), so this project contain one admin and multiple client using same client file.

To run this project firstly run the server file.
There you see the IP address of that device to which you run that server file.
Now open the client file and replace the SERVER_IP to that IP.
Now your client file is ready, save the changes, send this file to one whom you want to chat as a client.
Their messages that they will sent to you will be shown on the server file interface with their names and their IP address.
